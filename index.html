                        <dd>The very first James Bond film sees Scottish actor Sean Connery bring the British character to life on the big screen. Agent 007 goes to Jamaica to investigate the death of a British intelligence chief. There, he meets Honey Ryder, the first Bond girl, played by Ursula Andress. Bond also discovers the existence of an evil organization known as Spectre (or Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion).</dd>

Number 5 in Spectre, a chess grandmaster named Kronsteen, devises a plan to obtain a Lektor cryptographic device from the Soviets while also planning revenge on Bond for killing Spectre operative Dr. No. The leader of the organization, the unseen Number 1, dispatches Rosa Klebb, aka Number 3, to make Kronsteen’s plan a reality.</dd>
